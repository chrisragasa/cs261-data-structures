Project: Oregon State University, CS 261 - Data Structures, Assignment 2

Description: This assignment is comprised of 3 parts: 1) Implementation of Dynamic Array, Stack, and Bag, 2) Amortized Analysis of the Dynamic Array, 3) Application of the Stack - Checking balanced parentheses, braces, and brackets

Date: Jan 21, 2018

Prerequisites: C99

Instructions to test/run code using the command line: 
1) Navigate to assignment-2 directory
2) In assignment-2 directory, use command: 'make'. This will compile all C source files and create executables.
3a) To test implementation of dynamic array, run command: ./testda
3b) To test implmentation of the stack (checking for balanced parentheses, braces, and brackets), run command: ./testda 'input string' 
	For example, if you want to test if the string "{}{]()" is balanced, run command: ./testda '{}{]()'
